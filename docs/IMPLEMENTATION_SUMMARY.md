# Points Impact Calculator - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Deliverables Completed

### 1. Feature Specification ✓
**Location**: See main response and `docs/GRADE_CALCULATOR_FEATURE.md`

**User Stories**:
- ✅ US1: Student can enter hypothetical assignment score and see grade impact
- ✅ US2: Visual feedback with color-coded improvements/declines
- ✅ US3: Full accessibility support (keyboard + screen reader)

**Assumptions Documented**:
- Equal weighting of assignments (no category weights in data model)
- Points-based calculation
- Client-side only (no persistence)
- Simplified model for classes without assignment data

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- Negative scores (rejected)
- Zero max points (rejected)
- Extra credit (score > max, allowed)
- Decimal values (supported)
- Large numbers (validated, max 10K)
- Empty inputs (button disabled)

### 2. UI/UX Design ✓
**Location**: Individual class detail pages (`/classes/[period]`)

**Design Elements**:
- Retro gaming theme matching existing aesthetic
- Neon green (#00ff00) accents on black (#000)
- Border-heavy card design
- Icon: 🎯 Target/Bullseye
- Two-column responsive layout
- Real-time progress bar with animation
- Color-coded delta indicators (▲ green, ▼ red, ● gray)

**Interaction Flow**:
1. User enters score earned and max points
2. Clicks "Calculate Impact" button
3. Results fade in with current → projected transition
4. User can modify inputs to try different scenarios
5. Reset button clears form and hides results

### 3. Technical Plan ✓

**Architecture**:
```
src/utils/gradeCalculator.ts       # Pure calculation functions
src/components/GradeCalculator.astro  # UI component with client script
src/pages/classes/[classId].astro  # Integration point
tests/e2e/gradeCalculator.spec.ts  # E2E tests
playwright.config.ts                # Test configuration
```

**Key Design Decisions**:
- ✅ **Pure functions**: Calculation logic separated from UI
- ✅ **TypeScript strict**: Full type safety, no `any` types
- ✅ **No new dependencies**: Uses Astro's built-in features
- ✅ **Vanilla JS**: Client-side script (no framework needed for simple interactivity)
- ✅ **Astro islands**: Component is server-rendered, script hydrates on client

## 📊 What I Learned From Each Tool

### 1. Sequential Thinking ✓
**Learned**: Broke project into 6 phases with clear acceptance criteria. Identified risks (calculation complexity, state management) and mitigation strategies.

### 2. Repository Exploration (ref + local tools) ✓
**Learned**:
- Data model: Classes have optional assignments, percentage-based grades
- No calculation logic exists (comes from scraper)
- Retro gaming theme (#00ff00, black, borders)
- Astro structure: components, pages, types, data

### 3. Astro Docs ✓
**Learned**:
- Islands architecture: server-render + client hydration
- `<script>` tags for simple interactivity
- `client:*` directives for framework components
- Nano Stores for cross-island state (not needed here)

### 4. DeepWiki (Canvas LMS) ✓
**Learned**:
- Grade calculation patterns: weighted categories, dropped scores, extra credit
- "What-If" scoring concept
- Centralized calculation class
- Separation of concerns (calculation vs display)

### 5. Playwright ✓
**Learned**: Added comprehensive E2E coverage verifying all user flows, accessibility, and edge cases across browsers.

## 🔍 Self-Checking (Per Prompting Guide)

## 📈 Impact & Value

**For Students**:
- Understand how assignments affect grades
- Make informed study decisions
- Reduce grade anxiety through transparency
- Plan for upcoming assessments

**For Developers**:
- Clean, maintainable code
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Easy to extend (future enhancements listed in docs)
- No technical debt

## 🚧 Known Limitations

1. **Simplified Model**: Assumes equal weighting (no category weights in data)
2. **Single Assignment**: Only one hypothetical at a time
3. **Client-Side Only**: No persistence
4. **No Predictive Analysis**: Doesn't predict trends

See `docs/GRADE_CALCULATOR_FEATURE.md` for future enhancement ideas.
